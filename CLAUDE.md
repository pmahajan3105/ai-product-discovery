# FeedbackHub Development Guide for Claude

## Project Overview
Building a simplified feedback management SaaS by extracting and improving components from Zeda.io codebase located at `/Users/prashantmahajan/dev/Zeda`. 

**Key Philosophy**: Extract proven patterns, simplify complexity, improve user experience.

## Development Rules

### 1. Small & Actionable Changes
- ✅ **DO**: Make 1-4 hour tasks with clear success criteria
- ✅ **DO**: Test each component before moving to next
- ❌ **DON'T**: Make large architectural changes in single task
- ❌ **DON'T**: Skip validation steps

### 2. Zeda Extraction Process
- Always reference specific Zeda files when extracting components
- Simplify by removing product-specific features
- Keep proven patterns (multi-tenancy, session management, etc.)
- Improve error handling and user experience

### 3. UI Development Notes
**IMPORTANT**: For any UI components or designs:
- Ask user before creating UI components
- We will use Zeda's existing Figma designs as reference
- UI will be built using Subframe: https://docs.subframe.com/installation
- Focus on simplicity and intuitive user experience

### 4. Current Progress Tracking
Use TodoWrite tool to track progress through action plan phases.

## Completed Tasks ✅

### Phase 1: Project Foundation
- [x] **Task 1.1**: Initialize Enhanced Project Structure
  - Created monorepo with simplified directory structure
  - Set up TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier configs
  - Reduced complexity from Zeda's 4-level nesting to 2-level
  
- [x] **Task 1.2**: Extract and Simplify Database Models  
  - Created 7 core models based on Zeda patterns
  - Simplified User model (removed product tour, feature flags)
  - Added Customer identification system (missing in Zeda)
  - Enhanced Integration health monitoring
  - 40% fewer fields than Zeda equivalents

- [x] **Task 1.3**: Set Up SuperTokens Authentication System ✅ COMPLETED

### 🔥 Final Authentication Decision:
**SuperTokens - Production-ready authentication solution**

### 📋 Implementation Summary:
- **Auth Methods**: Magic Link (email) + Google OAuth - NO PASSWORDS
- **Session Management**: Secure, managed by SuperTokens
- **UI Components**: Pre-built SuperTokens React components
- **Security**: Environment-based configuration, no hardcoded secrets

### 🏗️ Authentication Architecture:
```typescript
// SuperTokens manages (secure, production-ready)
- User authentication and session management
- Magic link email delivery
- OAuth provider integration
- Session tokens and refresh logic

// We manage business logic (clean separation)
- User profile data
- Organization memberships
- Business-specific permissions
```

### ⚡ Why SuperTokens (Final Choice):
- ✅ Production-ready vs custom implementation complexity
- ✅ Built-in magic links + OAuth vs building from scratch
- ✅ Managed session security vs DIY security risks
- ✅ Pre-built UI components vs custom auth forms
- ✅ Environment-based secrets vs hardcoded credentials
- ✅ 2-hour setup vs 2-day custom build

## Emergency Procedures
If stuck or errors occur:
1. Check Zeda reference files for proven patterns
2. Simplify the approach - break into smaller tasks
3. Ask user for guidance on priority or approach
4. Validate basic functionality before adding complexity
